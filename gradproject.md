## Introduction

The graduate project is offered only to students enrolled in Data C200, CS C200A, or Data 200S. Other students are welcome to explore the questions and datasets in the project for personal learning, but their work will not be graded or counted towards their final grades.

The purpose of the project is to give students experience in both open-ended data science analysis and research in general. In this project, you will work with **one or any combination** of the following datasets provided to you to explore research questions that you define.

**Project criteria**: In addition to the general guidelines, each dataset option below has its own set of additional requirements for Report Format and Submission. Be sure to consult the correct section for your project option.

**Grading**: You will receive peer review feedback before the final deadline, and you are expected to incorporate the peer feedback into the final report and presentation. You will be graded on both the final report and presentation, as well as deliverables before the submission of the final reports (including submission of your peer reviews).

**Teamwork**: You can work alone or in a group with **at most two other students**. If you are interested in working with others, we have an [Ed post](https://edstem.org/us/courses/33744/discussion/2446765) for teammate search. Everyone in the same group will receive the same grade. The group size will be taken into consideration when grading.

## Timeline 


| Week (exact datetime TBD)	| Event / Deliverable           | Link           |
|--------------------------	|------------------------------	| -------------- |
| Week 8 (~3/10)            | Full grad project and datasets are released  | |
| Week 10 (week of 3/20)    | Research proposal, project teams due         | |
| Week 12 (week of 4/10)    | Checkpoint due                               | |
| Week 14 (week of 4/24)    | First draft of final report due, peer review starts | |
| Week 15 (RRR week)     	  | Peer review due                              | |
| Week 16 (Finals week)     | Revised final report, presentation video due | |


**Late Policy:** You may submit the **final report** and the **presentation video** late with a 10% penalty to that portion of your project for each day it is late. You may submit up to two days late. Submission times are rounded up to the next day. That is, 2 minutes late = 1 day late.

## Deliverables and Grade Breakdown

| Deliverable                          	| Weight 	|
|--------------------------------------	|--------	|
| Research proposal and project groups 	| 10%    	|
| Checkpoint                            |  2%     |
| Submission of first draft            	| 10%    	|
| Peer review                         	| 13%    	|
| Final report: Analysis notebook      	| 20%    	|
| Final report: Project writeup        	| 30%    	|
| Final presentation video             	| 15%    	|

The project checkpoint is a quick Google Form to assess if you are making progress towards your goals.

## Datasets

This section contains the datasets we will provide to you to explore your research questions.

- You must incorporate **at least one** of the provided datasets.
- You are welcome to **bring in additional datasets** to complement the datasets provided here, but you must cite the sources and clearly describe the content of any additional data you use in the final report.

The datasets will be released when the full project is released in March.
