Hi! I'm a Senior studying computer science and statistics with a minor in education. This is my 5th semester as a TA, so I'm a bit of an oldie. However, I love cooking, hiking, board games, and cats! You can frequently find me in the first floor of Moffitt or on the fire trails. Hopefully we can have a fun filled semester together!
